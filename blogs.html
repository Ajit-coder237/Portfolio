        How to stay motivated as a coder/ Programmer?
       </p>
       <p class="answer">
        These are the frequently asked questions by all the fellow programming aspirants and today we are going to find out the real solution by going to the depth of this ever-bothering problem. For a successful programmer, the first prerequisite is to stay motivated and creative along with a dream and a vision to contribute a bit in the field of IT. But coding is not a piece of cake and to master it we need to have a certain level of dedication and perseverance. The ability to spend most of your life in front of a computer doesn't just come from you. You really have to keep up your spirit high. <br>
        <br>
        But let's be really honest here. We all came into this field for money and a good lifestyle. We all know our inner voice. To have a mac in your bag and an iPhone in your hand you need to do a little bit of sacrifice. If you are in the CS field consistency has to be maintained. This is the only field where skill matters and nobody will ask you to show your GPA in any course. So maturity should hit you which makes you realize that to master a skill I need to maintain and comprise in certain things. That's the real problem and let's face it straight. How to keep your motivation high? We all know the fact that having a good bank balance and a rich lifestyle is everybody's dream but not everyone's dream is fulfilled because they only keep it to dreams and never dare to make it a living reality. Every successful person in whatever aspect you want to consider a huge success has one thing in common. They also dream big as a normal person but what creates a big difference is they don't keep it a mere dream but they transform it into their goal and plan. They work for it giving their hundred and the thing in every big name like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Elon Musk missing is fear of losing and fear of being criticized by their society.<br/> <br/>
        They know that to reach the peak of the summit like Mount Everest small difficulties will try to block their way. But they all throughout the course of their life and from many failed attempts have learned one thing no matter what situation life throws at you make yourself hungry for the goal and just walk over it. Dreams, strong burning desires, and necessity make you run and work tirelessly until you reached the summit. The comfort of laziness and not doing anything productive will make you a mediocre human being. We all know a fact that being human means we don't have any limitations and possibilities are infinite. There is nothing a human cannot achieve. So why do we waste this precious life crying on little things like nothing is happening the way I want, situations and opportunities always bypass me? <br/> <br/>
        Life is a combination of a limited amount of time and energy. So life is too short to cry, complain, and do stupid things. For no one in this universe, things happen 100% as they want. We have to hustle to make things work for us. And Motivation that goes from outside to inside is limited but inspiration and fire to achieve your dream that comes from within have no limit. To develop and search for a desire to work in Programming. Create a big vision and goal and burn yourself to become what you have planned to be. <br/>
